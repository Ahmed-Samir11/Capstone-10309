# This is Group 10309 Capstone Project.

The purpose of the study is to tackle the issue of climate change in Egypt, specifically the inundation of coasts.
The solution was decided based on the Engineering Design process. After going through the process many times, we reached the conclusion that Egypt's coasts are a prominent aspect of tourism, and hence the decision to start tackling the issue before it reaches danger levels.
The solution consists of a mobile app developed using Flutter, and using ultra-sonic, temperature, and humidity sensors. In addition to uploading the data collected from sensors to Google Firebase, which enabled us to not only to collect data, but also real-time monitoring.
